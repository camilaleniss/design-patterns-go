# design-patterns-go

Tasks done by doing the Udemy Design Patterns in Go course <https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-go>

In this course we will cover:

- SOLID Principles
- Creational patterns: are concerned with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- Structural patterns: are primarily concerned with object composition, allowing you to create more flexible and efficient relationships between objects.
- Behavioural patterns: focus on how objects collaborate and interact to accomplish tasks, responsibilities, and behaviors within a software system.
