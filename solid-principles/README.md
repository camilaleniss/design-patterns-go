# SOLID Design Principles

Five design principles introduced by Uncle Bob :)

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle

A type/class or whatever should have a single primary responsibility.
You can create another type to handle another responsibility.
Maybe break into packages as well -> separation of concerns

## 2. Open-Closed Principle

Types should be open for extension, but close for modification.
It's well illustrated using Specification pattern.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle
